        Just a 1 or 2 days ago I got a brand new laptop!
        It is really fast and amazing.
        This is my first personal electronic besides my tablet and Nintendo 3ds. I am really excited to have my own laptop! So I take care of it every day and make sure it is fully charged! I am writing this 2nd Post using my brand new laptop! End of Post.

        <p>Guys, I am so sorry for not doing any videos for like a super long time! It's just that i have been really busy with virtual school and my new laptop and the library is curbside pickup and so I have not been having any time for recording videos. Tomorrow, I am going to record a Minecraft video that may be a series. Who knows? It depends on how much you guys like the video. And no, i don't mean actually clicking the like button. I mean about how you feel about the video. So if you love the video, I will do more. Oh Yeah, I Totally Forgot! I actually have a special guest on the Minecraft video, and he may be possibly a kinda famous YouTuber. Although, he's my friend and goes to the same school as me and has lots of work! Also, to give you a hint, he is related to Bendy. If he's not there, then my other friend will be there but not a Youtuber. I hope you enjoy the video tomorrow!</p>

        <p>You Guys know how I promised to do a video today? Well, I forgot. Also, the day didn't go the way I thought it would go so that also messed up my schedule. So, I haven't been getting any spare time on my hands. I'm very sorry but I may not be able to record any videos for a few days. Although, I probably will be able to tomorrow since it's Saturday. But, I offer no gurantee that I will record a video that day. The day after tomorrow, Sunday, I'm not really sure since it's a family day. </p>
