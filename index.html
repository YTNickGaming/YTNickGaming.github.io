    My channel Nikki Boy is now about everything!
    Although I may do a mystery video totally not about unboxing!<br>

    Hey Everyone! <br>
    So I just got a camera and tripod and I figured I use that to record my YouTube videos. Just recently I have been using it for YT videos. If you have been watching my recent videos you see that the video quality and audio quality has improved greatly. If you like the better video and audio quality then like my videos!
