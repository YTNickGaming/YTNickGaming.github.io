        Basic Info
    </h2>
    <p>
    Nick Gaming is mostly about gaming.
    Although I may do a mystery video totally not about unboxing!<br>
    You guys will just have to wait for it!
    I like having something you guys are waiting for!<br>
    I love to do gaming videos on my channel but, <br>
    I did 2 reading videos once! <br>
    I feel like you guys loved it.
    If you want me to do another 1 than please say it in the comments for YT(YouTube) or the Questions box in here on KA(Khan Academy). <br>
    That was the basic info! <br>
    ONWARDS!

    Hey Everyone! <br>
    So I just got a camera and tripod and I figured I use that to record my YouTube videos. Just recently I have been using it for YT videos. If you have been watching my recent videos you see that the video quality and audio quality has improved greatly. If you like the better video and audio quality then like my videos!
